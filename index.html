    <li>üé® <strong>Mural Alley</strong> ‚Äì Behind Market and San Joaquin streets, you‚Äôll find a tucked-away corridor filled with vibrant murals, layered tags, and evolving public art. It‚Äôs a favorite photo spot for locals and totally free to explore. See also: our <a href="#free-things">DIY Mural Tour</a>.</li>

    <li>üõçÔ∏è <strong>Buttercup Home Interiors</strong> ‚Äì Part vintage boutique, part local artist co-op, part greenhouse. This off-the-radar shop mixes art prints, plants, gifts, and weird-but-wonderful energy.</li>

    <li>ü•ñ <strong>Genova Bakery</strong> ‚Äì A nearly 100-year-old Italian bakery hidden in a residential block. Still family-owned. Still baking fresh bread daily. Walk in, take a deep breath, and grab a sandwich or two.</li>

    <li>üé≠ <strong>The Write Place</strong> ‚Äì A hidden black-box theater and storytelling space nestled inside a strip center. Check their schedule ‚Äî performances and workshops rotate monthly and are often donation-based.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These spots don‚Äôt scream for attention ‚Äî they quietly win people over. If you‚Äôre the kind of traveler who values realness over ratings, add these to your list. They‚Äôre part of what makes Stockton feel like Stockton.</p>
