  <h2>Hidden Gems in Stockton</h2>
  <p>Some of the best things in Stockton aren’t on the billboards — they’re tucked into alleyways, side streets, and unassuming storefronts. These hidden gems might not show up on top-10 lists, but they’re where locals go when they want something real, low-key, and memorable.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>🥟 <strong>Best Lumpia</strong> – It’s not a marketing gimmick — that’s literally the name, and it delivers. This humble counter spot serves some of the crispiest, most craveable Filipino lumpia in the Central Valley. Pair it with garlic rice and sit outside.</li>
    
    <li>🎨 <strong>Mural Alley</strong> – Behind Market and San Joaquin streets, you’ll find a tucked-away corridor filled with vibrant murals, layered tags, and evolving public art.

    <li>🥖 <strong>Genova Bakery</strong> – A nearly 100-year-old Italian bakery hidden in a residential block. Still family-owned. Still baking fresh bread daily. Walk in, take a deep breath, and grab a sandwich or two.</li>

    <li>🎭 <strong>The Write Place</strong> – A hidden black-box theater and storytelling space nestled inside a strip center. Check their schedule — performances and workshops rotate monthly and are often donation-based.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These spots don’t scream for attention — they quietly win people over. If you’re the kind of traveler who values realness over ratings, add these to your list. They’re part of what makes Stockton feel like Stockton.</p>
